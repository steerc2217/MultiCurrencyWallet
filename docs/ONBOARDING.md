# Onboarding plan for developer

## TLDR: I want to do something!
1. Choose one of the [`good first issues`](https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) (or just [`issues`](https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/issues)) and click `assign yourself`
2. Do it! We are waiting for pull requests.
