# Why do you want to contribute to the 1inch Network? *

Our network contains more than 1000 Whitelabel wallets built by our tool which has been used by more than 1000 developers to build their projects (landing page + online crypto wallet ). 200 of them paid us for this tool https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064, 400 use free version https://wordpress.org/plugins/multi-currency-wallet/ .  Our client is a newbie web developer or "no-code" or "low-code" developer who wants to build a crypto project (mostly he doesn't care which!) without coding skills. Some of these developers have their own community and want to provide a crypto product to their community. 10 of them asked eth-erc20 exchange, 4 of them asked visa to erc20 (literally sell tokens to his users via credit card), 1 pays 1000$ to get the visa to erc20 bridge (and another onу want to pay also but waiting for demo). We planned to use the 1inch Network as a backend (using your API) which solves this problem for our clients and users.


# Select the category *
Network development: Integrations that help increase the usage of 1inch products and development of technologies beneficial to the 1inch Network.
Community development: Enabling teams and individuals to strengthen the 1inch Network through education, events and social outlets.
Research and analytics: Projects that provide key insights vital for the 1inch Network’s growth, competitiveness and product/market fit.

Network development - our case.


# Describe your proposal in one sentence: *

We will deliver 1inch functionality (Pathfinder and Limit Orders Protocol) into our network of blockchain wallets counted 1000+ sites, then expand the network by adding our tool to other developer's marketplaces (such as Cloudflare apps, amazon marketplace, and so on). Provide long-time support and improvements.


# Tell us more about your project *
SwapOnline is an open-source non-custodial multi-currency wallet with decentralized exchange based on the atomic swap. We distribute our code using Github and WordPress platforms (more platforms such as Cloudflare Apps are soon). Now we sell our wallet as a plugin for the WordPress platform and at this moment it is the top 1 simplest cryptocurrency wallet widget on codecanyon.com and pugins.woprdpress.org. Our mission is to simplify the introduction of new users and developers in the blockchain ecosystems without developer skills. By default, our wallet provides atomic swap exchange between different blockchains. We have partnership agreements with litecoin, bitcoin cash, ghost by McAfee, Next chain. For now, we can offer only cross-chain exchanges. But most of our payable clients need fast exchange only in a single network - ETH or BSC. We believe 1inch provides some of the best and most available services in this area.

Usecases for different types of users:

- Native JS Developers. we are an open source project and anyone can fork our project on github for their own needs. Like the client plugin, they have their own users.
- WordPress plugin users (no-code developers). who wants to make their own crypto brand/product. He will install our plugin on his domain and will customize the wallet with his own logo, colors, landing page, etc.
- Usual user who wants to exchange his assets. He will open our or any other application from our customers and can make a fast exchange on the available chains through 1inch Network. Also if he wants to create an order with the special price it also will be available with the Limit Orders Protocol. At this time we know about 40000 wallets who generated addresses using our network.

All of this significantly increases the number of users our product. Afterward it will subsequently increase the number of users of 1inch Network.

"What problem does it solve?"
10 times developers (our clients) asked us about eth-erc20 exchange, 4 of them asked visa to erc20 (literally sell tokens to his users using credit card), 1 paid 1000$ to get visa-to-erc20 bridge (and another onу want to pay also but waiting for demo).

"How will it succeed?"
A lot of new developers will use or tool not only to build their own wallet but also deliver new "crypto" exchange, DeFi, and other crypto stuff to their communities under their own brand.

"In what ways will it help strengthen and grow out the 1inch Network?"
More and more developers are using our tools we planned to port the code to other platforms, marketplaces such as Cloudflare apps, amazon marketplace, etc. In more ways, more developers in our network and more final users will use the exchange.

# In what ways does your project stand out from the competition? *

We focused on "no-code" developers. Our clients are developers who add our wallet as additional functionality on their platforms, one of our clients is GHOST by McAfee, NEXT.coin etc., you can find more our clients here (https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/blob/master/docs/CLIENTS.md).

# What level of support do you expect throughout the project completion process? *

we will use your API, we expect you will fix the bugs (if them will found) and add simple functions (such as callback after success payment). Best if you can provie "visa-to-customerc20" api endpoint. But current API methods is enough. 

# What is your estimated timeline (with milestones) for completion of the project? *
There is no deadline, we will add eth-to-erc exchange ASAP, we planned to deliver all your new stuff (NFTs, DeFi etc.) as they release,  to clients using our own network. See milestones...

# What stage do you expect to be the most challenging?
Long-term sustainability. By default, we can add your API easily, but we made tons of changes every day based on feedback from our clients, we should not only do "simplest" integration but deliver a better user experience. The biggest problem in crypto: core developers can get tired, move to another project, die, burn out. We have built a recruitment, onboarding, and training process with a focus on strong specialists (we require knowledge of bitcoin scripts) for long project life.

# What is the size of funding you expect for completing each milestone of the project? *
Milestones (all milestones include 2-year support and improvements):

1. simple API connection (beta), work with real customers who really want it to finalize beta version. (70 000)
2. improve UX (provide visa-to-erc bridge), develop dashboards, metrics, and so on (70 000)
3. Expand the network to new platforms such Cloudflare apps, amazon marketplace, Heroku, etc.. (100 000)
4. integrate other stuff 1inch team will develop (70 000)

These funds are required to 100% solve HR issues (finding devs, educating, and motivating the old developers) for two years.

# How will the project be maintained upon completion of the grant? Will any external sources of funding be available to ensure long-term sustainability? *
We propose to create a multi-sig fund which will use only with reporting by human-hours (we use monitask.com to track) and specific GitHub issues related to 1inch, exchange UI, and so on.  Also, our clients pay us to get the workable application so we will maintain this as long as our clients will need this.
