>1. In order to facilitate the deployment please send us all relevant deployment and development addresses.

>2. While we have enabled fees in the network to facilitate getting accurate costs benchmarks, we’re going to be covering some of the fees for deployment and testing for the early developers particularly because fees will be higher in the early days as usage is restricted and therefore batch sizes are quite low. We’ll send you ETH on your L2 address directly. Which address would you like us to fund? We have enabled bridging from L1 to L2 for ETH and will soon enable for ERC-20s across as well.

>3. We're excited to add you to the developer whitelist, but please note that this stage is only for deploying contracts and testing.

ok

>4. During the whitelist period, please limit the amount of funds sent over the bridge to those that you need for deployment and testing, including testing integrations with other projects that are deploying. The whitelist and early access is being given for development and testing, so please refrain from transferring any significant liquidity until we remove the whitelist.

ok

>5. Arbitrum contract address generation works just like Ethereum. If you'd like to have your contracts deployed at the same addresses as on Ethereum then make sure you're using the same deployment address and nonce as when you deployed on Ethereum. You may want to provide us with 2-3 addresses so that you can do some preliminary testing without burning nonces from your deployment addresses.

ok

>6. The developer interest has exceeded our expectations, and over 250 teams have requested early access. To ensure that we can handle all incoming support requests, we will whitelist in batches beginning this past Friday and extending into next week. So that nobody is disadvantaged by this, we are guaranteeing that you will have at least 2 weeks from the time that we add you until we open up for users. Once you send us your addresses, we will add you to our whitelist queue and message you once you've been granted access. You should receive access within 24-48 hours of sending us your addresses.

ok
>7. If your project has any ERC20s, let us know if you plan on the L2 contract to be a "StandardArbERC20" (Open Zeppelin standard + EIP 677 features, plus "bridging functionality), or a custom token contract. Note that regardless when / if a custom token is registered, funds will be safe / recoverable, we just want to ensure that our arb1Tokens.json list shows your preferred, canonical address. For more info see https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets.

>8. Please share your feedback with us and let us know how we can support.

We're excited to have you join us and let's scale Ethereum together!
