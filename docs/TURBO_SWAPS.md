# Turbo swaps

The shortest and fastest way to cross-chain p2p cryptocurrency exchange.

⚠️ Turbo swaps at the early alpha stage - please be careful!


## How to become a trusted turbo maker?

1. Send "I want to be a trusted maker!" to [https://t.me/swaponlinebot](developers)
2. Get instructions
3. Make a SWAP deposit (if you have not purchased the plugin)
4. You will be added to the [trusted makers whitelist](/src/common/whitelists/trustedMakers.ts)


## Why do we need a whitelist?

It is needed to protect TurboSwap-takers in case of dispute.

At this stage, this whitelist is filled in manually by swaponline devs.


## Trusted / Untrusted UI

- (✔️) - Trusted turbo makers; takers are protected
- (⚠️) - Ordinary turbo makers; no takers protection
